## Block chain concepts

- Length of block chain prevents
  - data in it to be changed difficult
  - greater the change, more difficult it becomes to change the data in previous blocks since hash changes
  - even in case of a milli bhagat, the minority can reject the block if it doesn't matches the contract. Complete chain needs to be accepted by all the nodes.

- Private/Public Key pair

  - for unauthorized amount or user, the signature will change and no longer remain the same. In this manner the transaction becomes immutable.
